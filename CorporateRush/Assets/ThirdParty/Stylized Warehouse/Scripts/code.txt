ShelfGenerator Documentation
Overview
The ShelfGenerator package provides tools for spawning and organizing prefabs within a Unity scene. It includes two main components: SpawnPrefabs and ShelfGenerator. These components facilitate the creation of multi-floor shelves and the spawning of random box prefabs with configurable spawn percentages.

Components
1. SpawnPrefabs
The SpawnPrefabs script allows you to spawn multiple prefabs in a specified direction and arrange them in multiple floors.

Parameters:

prefabToSpawn: The prefab GameObject to be spawned.
numberOfPrefabs: The total number of prefabs to spawn.
numberOfFloors: The number of floors each prefab will have.
prefabSpawnDistance: The distance between each spawned prefab.
floorSpawnDistance: The distance between each spawned floor.
Usage:
Attach the SpawnPrefabs script to a GameObject in your scene. Set the parameters as needed in the Inspector. When the scene starts, the prefabs will be spawned according to the specified parameters.




2. ShelfGenerator
The ShelfGenerator script allows for the spawning of box prefabs with specific spawn probabilities, arranged in a single row on a shelf.

Parameters:

boxSpawnData: An array of BoxSpawnData objects, each containing a box prefab and a spawn percentage.
numBoxesPerShelf: The number of boxes to spawn per shelf.
BoxSpawnData Class:

boxPrefab: The prefab GameObject to be spawned.
spawnPercentage: The percentage chance of this box being spawned, ranging from 0 to 1.
Usage:
Attach the ShelfGenerator script to a GameObject with a BoxCollider component. Set the parameters in the Inspector. The script will generate the boxes when the scene starts, based on the defined probabilities.
